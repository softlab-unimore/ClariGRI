**Summary of Eni's Performance (2023)**

1. **GHG Emissions:**
   - Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) decreased slightly from 39.39 million tonnes CO₂eq in 2022 to 38.69 million tonnes in 2023 (Page 163, Table 0, Row 2).
   - The carbon efficiency index (Scope 1 and 2) improved marginally from 32.67 tonnes CO₂eq/thousand boe in 2022 to 31.9 in 2023 (Page 163, Table 0, Row 6).
   - Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) increased from 0.79 million tonnes CO₂eq in 2022 to 0.73 in 2023 (Page 163, Table 0, Row 12).

2. **Energy Production:**
   - Electricity produced from renewable sources rose significantly from 2.836 GWh in 2022 to 4.242 GWh in 2023 (Page 163, Table 0, Row 18).
   - Total energy consumption increased from 503.2 million GJ in 2022 to 516.2 million GJ in 2023 (Page 163, Table 0, Row 21).

3. **Biofuels Production:**
   - Sold production of biofuels decreased from 428 ktonnes in 2022 to 635 ktonnes in 2023 (Page 163, Table 0, Row 26).

4. **Natural Gas Supplies:**
   - Total supplies of Eni's consolidated subsidiaries decreased from 60.59 million GJ in 2022 to 50.05 million GJ in 2023, marking a decline of 17.4% (Page 74, Table 0, Row 11).

5. **Power Generation and Trading:**
   - Power generation fell from 21.37 TWh in 2022 to 20.66 TWh in 2023, a decrease of 3.3% (Page 96, Table 1, Row 1).
   - Trading of electricity saw a significant decline of 30%, from 9.49 TWh in 2022 to 6.64 TWh in 2023 (Page 96, Table 1, Row 2).

Overall, Eni has shown improvements in carbon efficiency and renewable energy production, but there are notable declines in total natural gas supplies, power generation, and trading activities.
