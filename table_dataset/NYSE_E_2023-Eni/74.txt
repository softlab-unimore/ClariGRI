Sales
European gas market was characterized by consumption reduction due to mild weather conditions which has negatively impacted civil sector consumption, due to weak electrical demand, as well as the recovery of the hydroelectric and nuclear sectors, resulting in a different consumption mix. In this scenario, demand decreased
by approximately 10% and 8% in Italy and in the European Union, respectively, compared to 2022. Natural gas sales amounted to 50.51 bem (including Eni’s own consumption, Eni’s share of sales made by equity-accounted entities) and decreased by 10.01 bem or 16.5% from the previous year due to lower sales in Italy and outside Europe.
