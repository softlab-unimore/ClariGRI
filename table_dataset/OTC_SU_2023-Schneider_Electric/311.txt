Due to the impact of rounding on individual elements within this disclosure table, numbers may not exactly sum to the Group total.
(1)
Out of scope energy consumption concerns mainly AVEVA, RIB Software and Larsen & Toubro and to a limited extent other small non-integrated entities.
(2) For sites below size thresholds for mandatory environmental reporting, energy consumption by source is estimated by multiplying site surface (m*) with energy intensity ratios (kWh/m?) measured in larger sites. For sites located in countries with country-level renewable electricity contracts, 100% of the estimated electricity consumption of the site is counted as renewable, as such supply contracts cover all sites within a country. 2023 includes 48,100 MWh of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) applied to sites in the estimated energy scope.
(3) 2005 estimated energy productivity is 12,408 € per MWh.
(4) Renewable electricity reported here includes renewable electricity purchased through Power Purchasing Agreements (PPA) or green tariffs, and electricity covered by Energy Attributes Certificates (EAC). The 2023 EAC account for 32.8% of total measured purchased renewable electricity reported.
