Then, align the table values by converting the needed values to a unique unit of measurement.
If the question specifies the unit of measurement, convert the values to that unit of measurement. Otherwise, you must decide the unit of measurement and convert the values.
You must not rewrite the tables. You must only eventually write a list of rules/formulas indicating how to perform the needed transformations. The transformations must exclusively be about the handling of units of measurement. Do not talk about anything else, including how to solve the question.
A sample rule can be:
1. 1000 meters = 1 kilometer
